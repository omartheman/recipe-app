12 Dec Wed

Priorities: 

- Add "Instructions" fields and tables to database
- Add Multiple image uploads, and image tables to database. 

=======================
11 Dec Fri

Success List: 
  - Add 'Loading...' for when nothing is displayed yet. 
  - Add columns in DB for preparation steps for the recipe. 
  - When you click 'Add Ingredients' button, make the new row appear first instead of last.
  
  - Add a user profile page, to edit password etc. 
  - Add a login form to a dropdown on the navbar 
  - Allow user to edit recipes on recipe page

  - Create a few test recipes, and add them to the homepage display.
  - Create a way to upload a recipe image

========================
(9 Dec Mon)
- Today I will create a page for the user to display all of their recipes. 
  -Maybe the User recipe page should be same as profile page? 
  -Start by just having a page where user can see their recipes. Later can decide to integrate it with profile page. 
- Need to list all recipes for user on their recipes page.
  - When we go to "My Recipes", we want the page to check for the loggedInUser, and then we want to display a list of the loggedInUser's recipes. Do we need a new route for this? 
    - What are the steps?:
      - We need to send a GET request to recipes table for all recipes from user 'test'
      - DB returns all recipes from user 'test' 
      - For our get request, we need a new route with the proper MySQL code for the DB retrieval. 
- Need to dynamically generate page for each recipe. 

- COMPLETED dynamic page generation.
TOMORROW: 
  - Tomorrow, fix so that apostrophes in the recipe upload don't mess up the server SQL code
  - Tomorrow, add 'Loading...' for when nothing is displayed yet. 
  - Add columns in DB for preparation steps for the recipe. 
  - When you click 'Add Ingredients' button, make the new row appear first instead of last.
  - Find out why viewing an incomplete recipe page logs out user in production. Or perhaps just prevent an incomplete recipe from being created by requiring all fields to be filled out. 
  - Find out why datbase doesn't allow duplicate name of recipe, even though each recipe has unique id 
========================
(8 Dec Mon)
-Today I successfully added fields to add ingredients to database. 
-Tomorrow I will create a page that displays all of a user's recipes.
-Each recipe will have a page dynamically generated. 

========================

(5 Dec Sat)

- Now that we can upload a new recipe, the next step is to add frontend fields for ingredients and amounts. 
- We need to add a username column to the 'recipe' table
- finally, we will connect the current user to the upload function

=========================

(4 Dec Fri)

My next step is to create a profile page for the user. After I create an MVP for the profile page, I will create a recipe upload page. 

Actually, I will create a recipe upload page first, because this takes priority in the MVP. If I have a way to uplaod recipes, then Britt can start uploading right away. 

Still need to add username column to recipes. This will let me keep track of whose recipe it is, and display that on the homepage. 

Database doesn't create new table right now if the item name already exists. 

=========================

(3 Dec 2020 Thu)

Right now I'm going to create a way to create a new account on the recipe app. I need to figure out how to upload the new user data to the database. I'm going to start by just uploading the username and login. 

Create account route complete. Now need to make it so:
  1. When you create an account, you are logged in and taken to a new page.
      a. Change loggedInUser state in App.
      b. In your Post route, create a new session with the username and login (or maybe just send the user to the login route?) 

==========================

Right now I'm trying to get React to work with express, so that express is sending Routes to React. 

The way it's currently set up is that the React app is running on the server, and It's using the express server just to get information about login and from the database. 

I want to use React with express so that I can set page url's in the browser, or refresh the page, and React will send me back to the React app.

My next step is to create a profile page for the user. After I create an MVP for the profile page, I will create a recipe upload page. 

Actually, I will create a recipe upload page first, because this takes priority in the MVP. If I have a way to uplaod recipes, then Britt can start uploading right away.

Right now I'm going to create a way to create a new account on the recipe app. I need to figure out how to upload the new user data to the database. I'm going to start by just uploading the username and login. 

Create account route complete. Now need to make it so:
  1. When you create an account, you are logged in and taken to a new page.
      a. Change loggedInUser state in App.
      b. In your Post route, create a new session with the username and login (or maybe just send the user to the login route?)

Right now I'm trying to get React to work with express, so that express is sending Routes to React. 

The way it's currently set up is that the React app is running on the server, and It's using the express server just to get information about login and from the database. 

I want to use React with express so that I can set page url's in the browser, or refresh the page, and React will send me back to the React app.
